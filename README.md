## My process

This is my first project. I've been studying HTML and CSS for less than a week. At first, it was quite easy, but during the process, I didn't really know how to handle the image, maybe it will look a bit strange on larger screens. Social media icons were also a bit of a challenge in the beginning, but I figured it out with a little bit of research.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
